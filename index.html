                        <h3>Intuitive, streamlined interface design</h3>
                        <p>I utilize industry best-practices, my knowledge of front-end code, and years of experience to produce
                            award-winning results. From dynamically-driven retail sites to games for children and mobile
                            apps, my designs cater to a wide variety of users and are efficient to build.

                        <h3>End-to-end experience design</h3>
                        <p>My approach to ensuring a great user experience includes more than just producing a beautiful online
                            experience. Through customer research, user testing, analyzing metrics/key performance indicators,
                            and competitive analysis my UX solutions mitigate risk and drive results. </p>

                        <h3>Building and leading teams</h3>
                        <p>I lead by example and have a proven track record of hiring and directing productive, well-balanced
                            UX teams. Whether its in-house or agency, my success at building great teams centers around balancing
                            skillsets and ensuring great personality dynamics.</p>

                        <h3>Partnering with Business &amp; Technology</h3>
                        <p>A successful experience must meet not only the user’s needs but execute on business objectives while
                            also being technologically strategic. I’ve spent my career collaborating with product managers,
                            business partners and development leads to create winning solutions.</p>
